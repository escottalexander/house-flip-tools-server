### Technology used

The House Flip Tools API was built using Node with Express, Morgan for logging, Sequelize for interfacing with the PostgreSQl database, Passport with bcryptjs for all authentication, and Mocha with Chai for the testing suite.

I had a blast building this project. I especially loved using a Postgres database as I had only used MongoDB prior to this project. It was lots of fun to build.
